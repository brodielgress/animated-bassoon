# Reading Mrs. Dalloway with the NLTK module
My project for the Python - Data Analysis Course 2

by Brodie Gress

## About

This project uses the NLTK module from Python to explore the language used within _Mrs. Dalloway_, by Virginia Woolf. 

## Requirements

Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook are required to run this program. If you need, [update or download Python here](https://www.python.org).

### Running Tests

You can also run unit tests to make sure your pandas methods and python function are working correctly.

1. Navigate to find unit tests within folder.
2. Run files one at a time:

	  `python test_pandas.py`

	  `python test_python.py`

    `python test_sql.py`

The `test_pandas.py` will log your unit test results with a timestamp in the `TRY_IT/text/log.txt` file.

## Code Louisville Requirements

Below, I explain how my project meets the Code Louisville requirements:

###### Category 1: Python Programming Basics
  * Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.
  * Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in your code.
  * Implement a regular expression (regex)


###### Category 2: Utilize External Data
  * Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc, and use that data in your application.


###### Category 3: Data Display
  * Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other representation


###### Category 4: Best Practices
  * Create 3 or more unit tests for your application.
